# CitiBikeTest
Preprocess and prepare CitiBike data, make some plots, run simple linear regressions to test and explore the relationship.
(This code was a speculation for a future project using more advanced tools and models to see if any interesting insights can be extracted from the CitiBike hourly data, either from the business-insight POV or from the city-study, transportation/population-flow POV.)
